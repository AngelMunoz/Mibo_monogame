# Service Composition

As your game grows, you will likely need services that are shared across your `init`, `update`, and `view` functions—things like Networking, Leaderboards, or Save Data.

Instead of passing these individually or relying on global state, we recommend creating a strongly typed "Composition Root" or "Environment" record.

## The Environment Context

You should initialize your services **before** you construct the program. This ensures they are ready immediately and avoids the "circular dependency" trap (needing the `Game` instance to create a service that the Game needs to run).

This pattern is often referred to as the **Env** (Environment) pattern in F# application architecture.

```fsharp
// The "Env" pattern
type Env = {
    Network: INetworkService
    Leaderboard: ILeaderboardService
}

// 1. Create environment independent of the program
let env = {
    Network = Network.create "https://api.example.com"
    Leaderboard = Leaderboard.create ()
}

// 2. Pass to program functions
//    (e.g., capture in a closure or pass as an argument)
let init = State.init env
let update = State.update env
```

## Avoiding Circular References

A common pitfall is trying to initialize a service inside your `init` function because it requires access to the `Game` instance or `GraphicsDevice`. This creates a circular dependency:
`Game` → `Program` → `init` → `Service` → `Game`

### Guidance

1.  **Prefer Independence**: Design services to be independent of the concrete `Game` instance if possible.
2.  **Escape Hatches**: If you absolutely *must* have a circular reference (e.g., a service that wraps a specific MonoGame subsystem), handle this carefully using:
    - F# `ref` cells or mutable fields initialized later.
    - Mibo's `ComponentRef` mechanism.
    - **Note**: These approaches are "know what you are doing" scenarios. Use them only when necessary.


> _**NOTE**_: If you prefer to use a DI container, you can create it at the same time as you would with the environment and pass it to the program.
>
> There's also the posibility that you can hijack the `Game` instance services but it is not recommended as those services are just available for the init and view functions, most of the time your simulation (update) is the one that either needs to access or be accessed by the services.

## Full Program Example

Here is how the whole picture fits together in `Program.fs`.

```fsharp
module MyGame.Program

open Elmish
open Mibo
open Mibo.Elmish

// 1. Define the Environment Type
type Env = {
    Network: INetworkService
    Leaderboard: ILeaderboardService
}

// 2. Define the Composition Root (Factory)
let createEnv () =
    {
        Network = Network.create "https://api.example.com"
        Leaderboard = Leaderboard.create ()
    }

// 3. Define Game Logic (Dependencies Injected)
let init (env: Env) (ctx: GameContext) =
    // Synchronous call (e.g. settings listeners)
    env.Network.Connect()

    // Async call (e.g. fetching data)
    let cmd = Cmd.ofAsync env.Leaderboard.Load () LeaderboardLoaded LeaderboardError

    { Score = 0; HighScores = [] }, cmd

let update (env: Env) (msg: Msg) (model: Model) =
    match msg with
    | ScoreChanged newScore ->
        // Trigger async operation
        let cmd = Cmd.ofAsync env.Leaderboard.SubmitScore newScore (fun _ -> ScoreSubmitted) ScoreError
        { model with Score = newScore }, cmd

    | LeaderboardLoaded scores ->
        { model with HighScores = scores }, Cmd.none

let view (env: Env) (ctx: GameContext) (model: Model) (buffer: RenderBuffer<RenderCmd2D>) =
    // Draw score, etc.
    ()

// 4. Assemble & Run (Entry Point)
[<EntryPoint>]
let main _args =
    // Create the environment FIRST
    let env = createEnv ()

    // partial application/inject the environment
    let init = init env
    let update = update env
    let view = view env

    // Compose the program with the Env captured
    let program =
        Program.mkProgram init update
        |> Program.withConfig (fun (game, gfx) ->
            game.Content.RootDirectory <- "Content"
            game.IsMouseVisible <- true)
        |> Program.withAssets
        |> Program.withRenderer (Batch2DRenderer.create view)

    // Run the game
    use game = new ElmishGame<Model, Msg>(program)
    game.Run()
    0
```

## Note on Async & The Game Loop

Common `Cmd.ofAsync` usage in Mibo follows standard Elmish rules: **it does not block the game loop**.

When you dispatch an async command:
1.  The `update` function returns immediately with the new model.
2.  The async work starts on a background thread (or the thread pool).
3.  The game loop continues running (rendering frames, processing inputs).
4.  When the async work completes, a new message is dispatched back into the loop.

This means you can safely perform heavy I/O (network requests, file saving) without causing frame stutters.
