# Scaling Mibo (Simple → Complex)

Mibo is designed to stay fun for small games while still giving you an upgrade path for “serious” games.
This document is a practical ladder you can climb as complexity increases—without rewriting your engine.

The recurring theme is:

- keep **state changes** serialized (Elmish)
- keep expensive logic **data-oriented** (snapshots + mutable hot paths when needed)
- introduce **explicit boundaries** (per-tick phases, and optionally frame-bounded dispatch)

## Level 0 — Pure MVU

**Best for:** card games, menus, puzzle games.

**Goal:** maximum simplicity.

**Model**: mostly immutable records.

**Update discipline:** handle one message at a time, return `Cmd.none` most of the time.

**Mibo helpers you’ll use:**

- `Program.mkProgram`, `Program.withRenderer`, `Program.withSubscription`
- `Cmd.ofMsg`, `Cmd.batch`

**What you gain:**

- trivially testable logic
- deterministic replay (record the message stream)

```fsharp
type Model = { Position: Vector2 }
type Msg = Teleport of Vector2

let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | Teleport pos -> { model with Position = pos }, Cmd.none

let view ctx model buffer =
    Draw2D.sprite texture (Rectangle(int model.Position.X, int model.Position.Y, 32, 32))
    |> Draw2D.submit buffer
```

## Level 1 — Add semantic input

**Best for:** Action-heavy games (platformers, arcade) where rebindable keys and state queries (is "Jump" held?) are essential.

**Goal:** stop sprinkling device-specific checks across gameplay.

**Pattern:** map hardware input → semantic actions → update your model.

**Mibo helpers you’ll use:**

- `InputMap` + `InputMapper.subscribe` (or `Program.withInputMapper` if you prefer services)
- model field like `Actions: ActionState<_>` updated by an `InputMapped` message

**Recommendation:** treat input as _data for the next simulation step_.

That usually looks like:

- `InputMapped actions` updates a field (`model.Actions <- actions`)
- `Tick gt` consumes `model.Actions` to advance simulation

```fsharp
type Action = MoveLeft | MoveRight | Jump

let inputMap =
    InputMap.empty
    |> InputMap.key MoveLeft Keys.Left
    |> InputMap.key MoveRight Keys.Right
    |> InputMap.key Jump Keys.Space

type Model = {
    Position: Vector2
    Actions: ActionState<Action>
}

let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | InputMapped actions ->
        { model with Actions = actions }, Cmd.none

    | Tick gt ->
        // Simulation now depends on the stored 'Actions'
        let dt = float32 gt.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds
        let dx =
            if model.Actions.Held.Contains MoveRight then 100.0f * dt
            elif model.Actions.Held.Contains MoveLeft then -100.0f * dt
            else 0.0f

        { model with Position = model.Position + Vector2(dx, 0.0f) }, Cmd.none
```

## Level 2 — Establish a simulation “transaction”

**Best for:** Growing projects where you need to prevent "spaghetti logic." By forcing all gameplay changes into `Tick`, you avoid race conditions caused by random events mutating state unpredictably.

**Goal:** keep your mental model simple when the game grows.

**Rule of thumb:**

> Non-`Tick` messages update _buffers_ (input snapshots, event queues, pending requests). Only `Tick` mutates the “world”.

This gives you an explicit boundary:

- gather external events during the frame
- run simulation once on `Tick`
- commit results

**Why it helps:**

- fewer ordering surprises
- easier to reason about “what changed this frame”
- makes later deterministic/multiplayer work much easier

```fsharp
type Msg =
    | InputMapped of ActionState<Action> // Just updates the input buffer
    | NetworkPacket of byte[]            // Just updates the network buffer
    | Tick of GameTime                   // The ONLY place physics/gameplay runs

let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | InputMapped actions ->
        { model with Actions = actions }, Cmd.none

    | NetworkPacket data ->
        // Buffering network data, not processing it yet
        model.NetworkBuffer.Enqueue(data)
        model, Cmd.none

    | Tick gt ->
        // 1. Read buffers (Input, Network)
        // 2. Run simulation (Physics, AI)
        // 3. Update world
        let newPos = Physics.integrate model.Position model.Actions gt
        { model with Position = newPos }, Cmd.none
```

## Level 3 — Phase pipelines + snapshot barriers

**Best for:** Complex simulations (ARPG, RTS) where update order matters. E.g., Physics must run before Collision, which must run before AI.

**Goal:** support many subsystems without turning update into spaghetti.

Mibo provides a type-guided pipeline in `Mibo.Elmish.System`:

- `System.pipeMutable` for mutation-heavy phases
- `System.snapshot` to freeze a readonly view
- `System.pipe` for readonly/query/decision phases

The pipeline accumulates a single `Cmd<'Msg>` (not a list), so it stays allocation-friendly even as you add phases.

See: [System pipeline (phases + snapshot)](system.html)

**Typical layout:**

1. Integrate physics / movement (mutable)
2. Update particles / animation state (mutable)
3. Snapshot
4. AI decisions, queries, overlap detection (readonly)
5. Emit commands/messages

This is an “ECS-ish” approach that works well even if your storage is still dictionaries/arrays.

> **Performance Implementation:** As you add more subsystems and entities, you will likely need to move from immutable lists to mutable collections to avoid GC pressure.
> See [F# For Perf: Level 3 (Mutable Collections)](performance.html#level-3--mutable-collections) for the implementation details.

```fsharp
// Example from MiboSample: splitting mutable physics from readonly logic

match msg with
| Tick gt ->
    let dt = float32 gt.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds

    System.start model
    // Phase 1: Mutable systems (can mutate positions, particles)
    |> System.pipeMutable (Physics.update dt)
    |> System.pipeMutable (Particles.update dt)
    // SNAPSHOT: transition to readonly
    |> System.snapshot Model.toSnapshot
    // Phase 2: Readonly systems (work with immutable snapshot)
    |> System.pipe (HueColor.update dt 5.0f)
    |> System.pipe (Player.processActions (fun id pos -> PlayerFired(id, pos)))
    // Finish: convert back to Model
    |> System.finish Model.fromSnapshot
```

## Level 4 — Fixed timestep and determinism

**Best for:** Networked games or physics-heavy simulations that require deterministic behavior independent of the user's framerate.

**Goal:** stable simulation independent of framerate.

**Pattern:** run your simulation in fixed slices.

You can do this manually (accumulator in the model), or use Mibo's framework-managed fixed timestep:

```fsharp
Program.mkProgram init update
|> Program.withFixedStep {
	StepSeconds = 1.0f / 60.0f
	MaxStepsPerFrame = 5
	MaxFrameSeconds = ValueSome 0.25f
	Map = FixedStep
}
```

- variable `GameTime` arrives once per frame
- your simulation runs in fixed steps (e.g. 1/60s) potentially multiple times

See: [The Elmish Architecture](elmish.html) (fixed timestep + dispatch modes)

**Guidelines for determinism:**

- put RNG state (seed) in the model (don’t call ambient `System.Random()` from update)
- avoid reading mutable global state from `update`
- represent time as data (the `Tick` message already does this)

> **Performance Implementation:** Physics logic executed multiple times per frame is the "hottest" path in your game.
> To keep this zero-allocation, see [F# For Perf: Level 5 (ByRef/InRef)](performance.html#level-5--byref-inref-span-and-memory).

```fsharp
// Using framework-managed fixed step
type Msg =
    | FixedStep of dt: float32
    | Tick of GameTime // Still used for interpolation/rendering

let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | FixedStep dt ->
        // Run deterministic physics
        let newPos = model.Pos + model.Vel * dt
        { model with Pos = newPos }, Cmd.none

    | Tick gt ->
        // Only update visual/interpolation state
        let alpha = float32 gt.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds / fixedStep
        let visualPos = Vector2.Lerp(model.PrevPos, model.Pos, alpha)
        { model with VisualPos = visualPos }, Cmd.none
```

## Level 5 — Frame-stable message processing

**Best for:** Strict lockstep architectures or rollback networking where you need a guarantee that no "stray" messages can slip into the current frame after processing starts.

By default, Mibo processes messages **immediately**: a message dispatched while the runtime is draining the queue can be processed in the same MonoGame `Update` call.

For some advanced architectures (strict frame boundaries, rollback/lockstep friendliness, avoiding re-entrant cascades), you may want:

> messages dispatched while processing frame N are not eligible until frame N+1.

Mibo supports this via `DispatchMode`:

- `DispatchMode.Immediate` (default): maximum responsiveness
- `DispatchMode.FrameBounded`: stronger frame boundary, up to 1-frame extra latency for cascades

Enable it like this:

```fsharp
Program.mkProgram init update
|> Program.withDispatchMode DispatchMode.FrameBounded
```

### Interaction with `Cmd.deferNextFrame`

`Cmd.deferNextFrame` delays an _effect_ until the next MonoGame `Update` call.
In `FrameBounded` mode:

- if the deferred effect dispatches immediately when it runs (synchronous dispatch), it will typically be processed **next frame** as expected
- if it dispatches later (async completion), and that completion happens while the runtime is draining messages, it may be deferred **one more frame**

This is not a bug; it’s the natural result of combining “defer effect execution” with “frame-bounded message eligibility”.

```fsharp
// Example: Spawning entities safely at the start of the next frame
// to avoid mutating the list while iterating it in the current frame.
let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | EnemyDied id ->
        let cleanup = Cmd.ofMsg (RemoveEntity id)
        // Ensure spawn happens cleanly next frame
        let spawnLoot = Cmd.ofMsg (SpawnLoot id) |> Cmd.deferNextFrame
         model, Cmd.batch [ cleanup; spawnLoot ]
```

## Level 6 — Avoiding GC on model updates

**Best for:** Games with large state that update every frame (RTS, simulation games) where you want to minimize GC pauses.

**Goal:** Eliminate allocations during the hot update loop.

**The Problem:** In the Elmish runtime, every update does `state <- newState`. For large models, this means allocating a new record every frame—pressure that eventually triggers GC:

```fsharp
// This allocates every frame for large models
let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | Tick dt ->
        // { model with ... } creates a new record allocation
        { model with Position = model.Position + model.Velocity * dt }, Cmd.none
```

**Solution 1: Structs (small models)**

For small models (< 64 bytes), make your model a struct. No heap allocation, just stack copying:

```fsharp
[<Struct>]
type Model = {
    Position: Vector2
    Velocity: Vector2
    Health: int
}

// This copies on stack—zero GC pressure
let update msg model =
    match msg with
    | Tick dt ->
        { model with Position = model.Position + model.Velocity * dt }, Cmd.none
```

**Trade-off:** Large structs copy a lot of data each update. Not ideal for 500+ field models.

**Solution 2: Reference types with manual field updates**

For large models, use a class with mutable fields. Update in-place instead of creating new instances:

```fsharp
type GameModel(childInit) =
    // Mutable fields—update in place
    member val Player: Player.Model = childInit with get, set
    member val Enemies: Enemy.Model[] = Array.empty with get, set
    member val Score: int = 0 with get, set
    member val Time: float32 = 0.0f with get, set

let update msg (model: GameModel) =
    match msg with
    | Tick dt ->
        // Update fields in place—no allocation
        model.Time <- model.Time + dt
        model.Player <- Player.update dt model.Player
        
        // Update array elements in place
        for i = 0 to model.Enemies.Length - 1 do
            model.Enemies[i] <- Enemy.update dt model.Enemies[i]
        
        // Return same instance
        struct(model, Cmd.none)
    
    | ChildMsg childMsg ->
        // Nested update with Cmd.map
        let newChild, childCmd = Child.update childMsg model.ChildModel
        model.ChildModel <- newChild
        struct(model, Cmd.map ChildMsg childCmd)
```

**Hybrid approach:** Mix immutable structs for small data with mutable collections:

```fsharp
[<Struct>]  // Small, copy-friendly
type Transform = {
    Position: Vector2
    Rotation: float32
}

type Entity() =
    member val Transform: Transform = Unchecked.defaultof<_> with get, set
    member val Health: int = 100 with get, set

type GameModel() =
    // Mutable array—entities updated in place
    member val Entities: Entity[] = Array.zeroCreate 1000 with get, set
    
    // Small struct—copied cheaply
    member val Camera: CameraState = CameraState.defaultValue with get, set
```

**Trade-offs:**

| Approach | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|------|------|
| Immutable records | Most games | Pure, testable, time-travel debugging | Allocates every update |
| Structs | Small models (< 64B) | Zero allocation | Copies data each update |
| Reference types + mutation | Large models | Zero allocation, minimal copying | Loses time-travel, harder to test |

**When to use this:**
- You've profiled and GC is causing hitches
- Your model is large (100+ entities, complex nested state)
- You're at Level 3-5 already and need more performance

**Debugging tip:** If you switch to mutable reference types, you lose Elmish's time-travel debugging. Keep a `snapshot()` function to convert to immutable for debugging:

```fsharp
member model.Snapshot() = {
    Player = model.Player
    Enemies = model.Enemies |> Array.copy
    Score = model.Score
}
```

## Choosing the right rung

You can ship a lot of games at Level 2–3.

- **Card/turn-based:** Level 0–1
- **Platformer/shooter:** Level 1–2
- **ARPG:** Level 3 (+ maybe Level 4)
- **RTS:** Level 3–4 (+ Level 5 if you want strict boundaries, + Level 6 if GC is causing hitches)

Pick the simplest level that fits your game today, and add the next pieces only when you feel the need.
